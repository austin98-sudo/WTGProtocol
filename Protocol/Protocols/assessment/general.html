          Protocols in this section are designed to guide the EMS provider in the initial and ongoing approach to
          assessment and management of medical and trauma patients
        </li>
        <li>
          The patient examination should focus on rapid assessment and interventions. On-scene management of high
          priority patients should be limited ot stabilization of life-threatening problems. Other procedures should
          always be performed while en-route to the hospital or a landing zone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scene time should be limited to rapid assessment and stabilization of life-threatening problems. Shorter scene
          tmies are desirable for trauma patients. Rescue efforts for patients that are entrapped or have access/egress
          problems should be coordinated to minimize scene time
        </li>
        <li>The receiving hospital should be notified with an appropriate amount of time to prepare for the patient</li>
        <li>
          At any time, if a provider is uncertain of how to best manage a patient, on-line
          <b>[Medical Control]</b> must be contacted for instruction
        </li>
